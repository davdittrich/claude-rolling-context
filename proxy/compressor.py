"""
Rolling Context Compressor

When context exceeds trigger_tokens, compresses old messages down to target_tokens
of recent context + a dense chronological summary of everything before.

Two summarization modes:

1. NATIVE (default): clones the exact request Claude Code just sent — same
   model, system prompt, tools, and message history up to the cut point — and
   appends one user message asking for the summary. Because the request is
   byte-identical Claude Code session traffic, it passes Anthropic's
   subscription OAuth classification (issue #4), and because the prefix was
   just sent by the chat request, it's a prompt-cache read instead of full
   input cost.

2. FLATTENED: used when a custom summarizer is configured
   (ROLLING_CONTEXT_SUMMARIZER_URL / _KEY / _FORMAT). Flattens the
   conversation to text and sends a standalone request — Anthropic format or
   OpenAI chat-completions format, so any local model or third-party API
   works (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, ...).

Pure stdlib — no external dependencies.
